# Purpose
`Riptide.Toolkit.Testing` is **not** supposed to be used in **any** project.
It's just a console application, built on .NET8, to test if Riptide.Toolkit works.

## Compatibility
`Riptide.Toolkit` is built on .NET Standard 2.0, while `Riptide.Toolkit.Testing` is built on .NET 8.
This means that apps which support `Riptide.Toolkit` might not support `Riptide.Toolkit.Testing` - Unity won't support it for sure.

But again - you are **not** supposed to use `Riptide.Toolkit.Testing` anywhere.
